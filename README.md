# InputManagerLite

####This **free, open source** version of dbqeo's InputManager is licenced under the [GNU General Public Licence v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). 

While the Unity game engine has many strengths, its input manager is not one of them.
This set of scripts allows users to save their preferred control scheme into a text file, and allows for easy creation of custom control schemes.

Here's our [Unity Asset Store]() page if you want to try it out for yourself! 

If you like our small project and want more, check out [Input Manager Pro]() or [Custom World Gen]()!

###List of Features
 - Save user-defined controls to a text file (can be obfuscated)
 - Easily access controls using the same format as the default InputManager (GetKey(), GetKeyDown(), etc)
 - Quickly create a menu for users to edit controls 
 - Customizable default controls (assign any keys you want)
 - Quality documentation (who doesn't like documentation?)

####Coming soon:
 - Simple Mode: No code required! Just click a few buttons included in our custom panel!

####PRO Only:
 - Utilize custom controls in three default control schemes (3D, 2D top-down, 2D sidescroller, more coming soon!)
