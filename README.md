# InputManagerLite

####This free, open source version of dbqeo's InputManager is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). 

While the Unity game engine has many strengths, its input manager is not one of them.
This asset allows users to save their preferred control scheme into a text file, and allows for easy implementation of custom controls.

Here's our [Unity Asset Store]() page if you want to try it out for yourself! 

If you like our small project and want more, check out [Input Manager Pro]() or [Custom World Gen]()!

###List of Features
 - Save user-defined controls to a text file (can be obfuscated)
 - Easily access controls using the same format as the default InputManager (GetKey(), GetKeyDown(), etc)
 - Quickly create a menu for users to edit controls 
 - Customizable default controls (assign any keys you want)
 - Quality documentation (who doesn't like documentation?)

####Coming soon:
 - Simple Mode: No code required! Just click a few buttons included in our custom panel!
 - Allow users to save their custom controls in presets (PRO feature)
 - Easy toggling between control schemes (PRO feature)

####PRO Only:
 - Utilize custom controls in three default control schemes (3D, 2D top down, and 2D sidescroller- more coming soon!)
 - Just drag control scheme script into your player object! That's it!
 - Create your own custom control schemes
 - Contains demo project to help you get started more quickly
